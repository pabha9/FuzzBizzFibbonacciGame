Solution to the swift-nav coding challenge posted
This code is a solution to the game that Swift-Nav has posted on their website. However this code is buggy. The program slows down when the program asks for sequences for n > 30. And the other bug is that if one number is divisible by more than one number, it prints out on different lines rather than the same one.
